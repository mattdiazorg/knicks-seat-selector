## 1. Content Completeness Approaches

### 1.1 Multi-Dimensional Information Framework
**Approach**: Structure summaries around key decision-making dimensions
- **View Quality**: Sightlines, obstructions, distance to court
- **Pricing**: Cost per seat, value rating, price tier
- **Accessibility**: Proximity to entrances, restrooms, concessions
- **Amenities**: In-seat service, WiFi quality, nearby facilities
- **Atmosphere**: Crowd energy, proximity to team bench, celebrity sighting likelihood

**Benefits**: Ensures no critical information is omitted; users can evaluate based on their priorities

### 1.2 Contextual Enrichment
**Approach**: Add comparative and contextual data
- Compare to similar sections (e.g., "20% closer than Section 200")
- Historical pricing trends
- Popular vs. underrated sections
- Game-specific considerations (rivalry games, special events)

**Implementation Example**:
```
Summary: Section 117 - Courtside Excellence
Price: $450/seat (Premium tier, +15% vs. season average)
View: Front row perspective, eye-level with players
Context: Most requested section for playoff games
```
